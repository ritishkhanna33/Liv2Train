# Liv2Train: Problem Statement

Assume that you are working at a startup Liv2Train. You have to make an MVP for a registry for Govt funded Training Centers with the following minimum requirements. In the MVP, you have to create a Spring project with support for two apis, which are explained below.

## First API
Create a POST api to create and save a new training center with the following
fields.
1. CenterName (text)* (less than 40 characters)
2. CenterCode (text)* (exactly 12 character alphanumeric)
3. Address (object)*
   - Detailed Address
   - City
   - State
   - Pincode
4. Student Capacity (number)
5. Courses Offered (List<text>)
6. CreatedOn (Epoch time generated by System, not by user)
7. ContactEmail (text) (If present, email should be validated)
8. ContactPhone (text)* (Phone number validation )
- Api should accept data in json.
- Validations for mandatory fields should be done, along with phone, email and size validations wherever mentioned in the aforementioned fields should be done
- As mentioned above with the fields, createdOn field should be populated from the
server based on the server timestamp, and the user’s input if present for this field
should be discarded.
● On validation failure, an appropriate error message should be shown. This should
be handled by Spring ExceptionHandler.
● On success, the api should return the newly saved TraningCenter information in
json format

## Second API
● Create a GET api to get list of all stored training centers information.
● Api should return the result in json format.
● In the absence of any training centers, we need to return an empty list in response.
